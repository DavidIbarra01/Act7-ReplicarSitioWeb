<p>CAC speaking events and gallery exhibits take place inside Hotel Contempo, at
309 1st Avenue, in Downtown Seattle. Just a walk to the Space Needle, and a
sampling of restaurants and shopping makes the venue a much sought-after
location for conferences, year after year.
Hotel Contempo is the perfect spot for a gathering of modern artists. Not only are
the conference rooms and halls decked with breathtaking contemporary art and
were commissioned to decorate them. From the Ross Monroe Purple suite filled
wall to wall with paintings to the Tess Lessinger Sculpted Universe suite, with
dozens of original sculptures, visitors are sure to be intrigued and comforted during
sculptures, but the individual rooms are as unique as the renowned artists who
their stay at Hotel Contempo.</p>

<h3>The Otter Renaissance Hotel</h3>

<p>Hotel founder, Henry Chasings, had a love of otters, having been raised in an
Alaskan village where otters played out his back door. As his tribute to the sea
creatures of his early days, Henry was insistent upon having an otter in every hall,
wall, and room inside the Otter Renaissance Hotel.</p>
