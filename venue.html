<h1>The Venue</h1>

<!--IMAGEN-->
<p>Hotel Contempo is the perfect spot for a gathering of modern artists. Not only are
the conference rooms and halls decked with breathtaking contemporary art and
sculptures, but the individual rooms are as unique as the renowned artists who

were commissioned to decorate them. From the Ross Monroe Purple suite filled
wall to wall with paintings in his palette of violet and lavender to the Tess Lessinger
Sculpted Universe suite, with dozens of original sculptures, including the bronze-
casted toilet, visitors are sure to be intrigued and comforted during their stay at
Hotel Contempo. For those who opt to stay at another location, there is no
shortage of hotels in Downtown Seattle. Ranging from shabby chic to the ultimate
in sophistication.</p>

<p>Hotel founder, Henry Chasings, had a love of otters, having been raised in an
Alaskan village where otters played out his back door. As his tribute to the sea
creatures of his early days, Henry was insistent upon having an otter in every hall,
wall, and room inside the Otter Renaissance Hotel.</p>
