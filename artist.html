<h2>About the event</h2>
<p>The Roux Academy’s annual conference and exhibit is designed to foster a close-
knit relationship amongst artists at various universities around the world. But sign
up early, as this not-to-miss conference sells out quickly, and the waiting list is long.
In addition, art students are encouraged to send in works from their school
portfolios to be considered for hanging in the CAC exhibit halls, as well as to be
selected as a Featured Artist. </p>

<p>A first-year student at the Roux Academy of Art, Media, and Design, Riley is
already changing the face of modern art at the university. Riley’s exquisite abstract

on the “Art of Abstract” during Thursday’s schedule.</p>
